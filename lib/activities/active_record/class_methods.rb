      # The above statement will create activities when
      # a <tt>Thing</tt> instance is created, updated or removed.
      #
      # By default, the activity tracker stores all
      # attributes. But you can specify which attributes you want to
      # save. Just overwrite the method <tt>to_activity</tt> on your
      # trackable model.
      #

      #     end
      #   end
      #
      # To track custom actions, you need to specify other options.
      # Imagine you want to track when a task is marked as completed.
      # You can add an activity to this action.
      #
      #   class User < ActiveRecord::Base
      #     has_many :tasks
      #
      #     activities_for :tasks do
      #        track :completed, :on => :update, :if => proc {|task| task.status_changed? && task.status == "completed" }
      #     end
      #   end
      #
      # You can also track when an attribute changes:
      #
      #   class User < ActiveRecord::Base
      #     has_many :projects
      #
      #     activities_for :projects do
      #       track :renamed, :on => :update, :if => :name_changed?
      #     end
      #   end
      #
      # There's also an <tt>:unless</tt> option. REMEMBER: you can't use the <tt>:unless</tt> and <tt>:if</tt>
      # options at the same time.
